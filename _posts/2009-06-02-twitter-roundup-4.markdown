	<li>I was at <a href="http://www.immergutrocken.de">Immergut Festival</a>. <a href="http://www.bodibill.de/">Bodi Bill </a>and <a href="http://www.jeansteam.de/">Jeans Team</a> were great. But I may not return to Immergut next year. The founder also stops doing the festival and his reasons (to be read <a href="http://jetzt.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/476785/1/1#texttitel">here</a> in german) are the same why I felt more and more uncomfortable being at the festival)</li>
