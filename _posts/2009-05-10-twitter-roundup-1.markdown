Preface: I'm going to sum up the interesting stuff I've <a href="http://www.twitter.com/freenerd">twittered</a> about in a weekly blog post. Good thing for people who do not use Twitter and good thing for me, to recap the week. We'll see how it will work out.

<ul>
	<li>My macbook is back from repair. <a href="http://www.imazing.de">The guys</a> finished work within 40 hours. Impressive. I'm not going to go to Gravis again.</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/index.php?action=petition;sa=details;petition=3860">petition</a> against blocking of websites in germany is still worth being signed by YOU ... now!</li>
	<li>I started using<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com"> Remember The Milk</a>. Going to have a long blog post about it later on.</li>
	<li>Bought <a href="http://mobileways.de/gravity">Gravity</a> Twitter Client for Symbian S60. Best client I've tried so far.</li>
	<li>There is a new <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Sachliche-Debatte-ueber-Internetsperren-gefordert--/meldung/137579">reason</a> to not be proud of the HPI.</li>
</ul>
