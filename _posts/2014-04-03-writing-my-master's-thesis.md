In December 2014 I started working on my master's thesis in [IT-Systems Engineering](http://hpi-web.de/). By April 2014, I started writing. Thoughts have the downside of being hard to verify. So I need more people to read this and give feedback, so I can better fight the neverending battle against doubt. And the most scalable way seem to be public blog posts.

This post is a _Table of Contents_ for all the posts around the thesis.

#### content posts

  * Dependability Threats (to be written)
  * A Fault Model for Distributed Systems (to be written)
  * [Measuring Availability of Services](/on-measuring-availability-for-services/)

#### meta posts

  * The Story of the Thesis (to be written)
  * Lessons learned (to be written)
