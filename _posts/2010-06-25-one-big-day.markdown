Today marks two major turnarounds in my life.

Today I have handed in my Bachelor's thesis. This means my Bachelor studies are finished now. Good bye university. We might meet again for a Master's degree someday ...

Also today I have signed a contract with SoundCloud. This means that starting in September I will be an API developer there.

Both are big news. I'm going to write more about each of them in the following days. But for now I am off celebrating!
