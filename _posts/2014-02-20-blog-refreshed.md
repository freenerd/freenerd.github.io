Some days ago, I've switched this blog under [freenerd.de](http://freenerd.de) from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The move had several reasons:

- **A new design** I want simplicity. Content is king. Also it had to be readable well on mobile.
- **Write posts in Markdown** The expressiveness of HTML is not needed for most of my content. Speed of editing is important. And I don't like [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG).
- **No Spam** Everyone who's been running a Wordpress installation over some time will have experienced hacking attempts and spam. By serving a static website, this became practically irrelevant. This also means, that I don't have to spend time updating my wordpress installation and its plugins anymore.
- **No traffic/scaling concerns** Hard to believe, but I had a hosting package at a german hosting company which basically didn't bring any change in the 10 yearsof contract. 10 years! This included an cap on traffic. Also, their machines were rather weak. On the other hand, they did the job, so it took me a long time to change things. Well, until now. I'm hosting on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) now.

I considered moving to a blogging platform, but I see [freenerd.de](http://freenerd.de) as my home address, which should not be subject to the product schedule of a venture-backed company [1]. If I'd have chosen a blog platform in 2004, it would have probably been [blogger.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger.com) and that has changed quite a lot since then ...

So I've been blogging since 2004. In these 10 years, I published nearly 800 posts. In most of them, I was trying out the medium, writing in German. During the move, I only carried over around 70 posts. Like the [first one](/first-post). My [excitement](/music-hack-day-berlin-recap) for the first [Music Hack Day Berlin](/music-hackday-berlin-announcement) in 2009. Working in [South](/first-workday-in-south-africa) [Africa](/second-and-third-workday-in-south-africa). Life events like finishing my [Bachelor's thesis](/my-bachelors-thesis-on-agile-software-development), [starting](/i-work-at-soundcloud) and [quitting](/goodbye-soundcloud) at SoundCloud. Being on [StartupBus](/me-startupbus-nyc-2012) and organizing [Art Hack Day Berlin](bringing-art-hack-day-to-berlin).

So what was in the 700 posts that vanished? Mostly boring, maybe embarassing notes of my past self. As a person, I think I've moved far in these years. And many things, that I've published back then do not contribute to my present me. Obviously, I want to convey an image of myself here (like: sophisticated tech literate). Party pictures from 9 years ago, if seen in the present context, would not contribute well.

Which brings me back to the fact that its nice to be able to rewrite my own history, on own terms. For that I will be able to reflect on this in 10 years again.

P.S. A shout out goes to [robb](http://robb.is) for helping me with the move. Thanks man!

[1] To be fair, I'm hosting on Github now, which is venture-backed, but this is hosting only and will hopefully never interfer with the hosted content. And even if so, moving to a new hoster could be done within an hour.
