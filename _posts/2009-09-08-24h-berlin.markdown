In the last days I've been fascinated by watching the "<a href="http://24hberlin.de/">24h Berlin</a>" project, which has been done by rbb and Arte. The basic idea was to have 80 camera crews following people in the city on their daily life on September, the 5th 2008 from 6:00 to 6:00. These huge amount of material has been compiled into one 24 hours long film, assembling the movie clips in a sort of real time order, with the different "plot lines" running parallel.

So we see an heroin addict, the chief editor of "Bild", garbage men, subway driver, the mayor, musicians, retirees, marketing directors, real estate agents, call-center employees, opera singers, immegrants and so on.

To date I have watched 6 hours (you can do something else meanwhile, just have it running in the background). It is interesting to see other peoples style of living (that they choose or where forced into). There are funny, serious, eye-opening and banal moments. It's a great way to reflect on ones very own life and to broaden ones view on the world.

You are able to watch the whole 24 hours as <a href="http://rbb-online.de/themen/dossiers/24h_berlin/24h_berlin/24hberlin_video_ondemand_verteilseite.html">video on-demand online</a> in an average but completely bearable quality. But you have to hurry. Streaming is only available until September 13th 6:00.
