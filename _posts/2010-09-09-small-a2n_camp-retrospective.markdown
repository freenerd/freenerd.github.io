In the beginning of this week I was at the <a href="http://www.a-2-n.de/">all2gethernow camp</a>. This are some of the things I took home from there. But I might be wrong on some or all parts ...

There is money to be made with music apart from signing a major record deal, like:
<ul>
	<li>Playing Gigs</li>
	<li>Selling Merch</li>
	<li>Get Donations (e.g. with <a href="http://flattr.com/">Flattr</a>)</li>
	<li>License your music to third parties</li>
	<li>Do clients work</li>
	<li>Sell your music to a small audience but get big cut of revenue</li>
</ul>

Music can not be sold as physical product anymore. It is changing to being an experience. The experience of being a fan of an artist and being constantly engaged with them. The goal for artists is to build a loyal fan base that stays with the artist for a long time and not only listens to music but is accesible in other ways like mail or sovial networks as well.

Music streaming (like <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>) does not generate substantial revenue for artists, but is great for building an audience and eventually making fans.

The people most complaining about the state are the ones that do not add value. The music industry has a massive infrastructure that is not needed anymore but still wants to be supported. One of the biggest problem with the decline of big labels is financing. Small artists have to find other ways like finding investors outside the music circus or bootstrap without big money.

"Everyone gets 15 minutes of fame" could be replaced with "Everyone gets 15 people one is famous to".
