Two years and six days ago I was a third-semester student and in the middle of an internship at SoundCloud. Additionally I played in an <a href="http://www.lastfm.de/music/a+golden+pony+boy">acoustic band</a> and, on that very Thursday, we had a gig in Admiralspalast Berlin. Before us played Mugison and, to cut the story short, he accidentally destroyed my guitar. (Read the full story in German <a href="http://www.freenerd.de/archives/2008/714/">here</a>. Damn, has my writing style changed ...)

Now, two years later I work full-time at SoundCloud and don't play in a band anymore. But today I discovered, by accident, that <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mugison/">Mugison uploaded a lot of his music to SoundCloud</a>. Many songs are free for download. And he even has a premium account. I hope he takes the discount code I've sent him so that he keeps using SoundCloud. This is the song that he played when my guitar got smashed:

I like that things constantly change and come and go. But it is also comfortable to know that things come back and that this life is going in big circles. I am super excited about what the future has to unveil ...
