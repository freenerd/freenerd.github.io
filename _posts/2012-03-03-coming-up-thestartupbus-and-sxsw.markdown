On the road. Tomorrow I will fly to New York and board the <a href="http://startupbus.com/">NYC StartupBus</a>. It will be 3 days, 3000 kilometers and 30 'buspreneurs' hacking and crafting on 3G internet on a bus driving cross country. We'll eventually land in Austin on March 9th for the beginning of South By Southwest.

I'm very excited about the bus trip. It seems that the bus will be filled with awesome people and high energy. I tend to get travel sick, so let's see how that pans out. Also somehow this whole project sounds like a silly idea, and I'm all in for silliness. I like working under constraints.

I'll stay in Austin for about a week, probably hanging out at the <a href="http://soundcloudopenhouse.com/">SoundCloud Open House</a> and the <a href="http://hypem.com/hotel/">Hypem Hotel</a> a lot. If you want to meet and talk about hackingz and starting things or give me a place to sleep (seriously!) you know <a href="http://www.freenerd.de/contact/">how to find me</a>.
