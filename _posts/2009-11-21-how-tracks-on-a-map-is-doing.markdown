About <a href="http://www.freenerd.de/archives/2009/1132/">1 1/2 months</a> ago <a href="http://www.tracksonamap.com">Tracks on a Map</a> has been launched. I want to do a small recap and see, where it is standing now.

The <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tracksonamap">twitter account</a> is the main channel for communicating about Tracksonamap. At the moment I'm unregularly sending out links to tracks or cities using the Tracksonamap share feature. I'm also thanking people for "you are awesome" tweets. Only 50 people are following the account right now which is a fairly small number. But since I don't want to join the spammy "i follow you so please follow back"-practice I'm just going to wait for new followers to arrive.

The <a href="http://github.com/freenerd/SoundCloud-Map/">Github repository</a> has experienced no traction at all.

There have been features on some blogs like
<a href="http://www.berlin-mitte-institut.de/interesting-soundcloudapp-tracksonamapcom/">Berlin Mitte Institut</a>
<a href="http://de-bug.de/medien/archives/soundcloud-weltreise-tracksonamap-com.html/">De:Bug</a>
<a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2009/11/soundcloud-google-map.html">Google Maps Mania</a>

The Admin-Dashboard of Google App Engine is no valuable source for metering the application. The thing I miss most is looking back more than 24 hours in usage statistics. I think that i have not been over quota yet (not even with 5000 visitors a day) and that we have been coding some solid code. At least that's what the logs indicate. The datastore sometimes gives timeouts which I suppose is Googles and not my fault. But I may want to build some error/retry handling around that someday.

Google Analytics says, during the last month about 40.000 unique users have been visiting Tracks on a Map. The main traffic driver was StumbleUpon. Looks as if we hit a nerve with the community there.

I'm currently planning the next iteration which will be again part of a seminar at university. I'm aiming on getting a 1.0 again, just like the last time ;)
