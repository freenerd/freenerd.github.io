<ul>
	<li>Nokia managed to piss me off. They launched the failing, not working, badly equiped and overall empty Ovi Store for Mobile Applications and I spent some time getting it to work. But it doesn't work.</li>
	<li>Furthermore I just bricked my E51 while trying to update the Firmware via XP in Parallels VM. Yes, no good setup, but why doesn't Nokia build Mac OS X software for firmware upgrades in the first place?
[Update: Fixed it with a Windows PC]</li>
	<li>I started a Twitter Account for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/diskodna">Disko DNA</a>.</li>
	<li>I went voting for EU parliament today.</li>
	<li>Have to see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzysbFcCYS8">this</a> movie someday.</li>
</ul>
