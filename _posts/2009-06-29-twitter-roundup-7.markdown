	<li>Woha. Google Employees are actually reading AND answering on the Google Maps API Mailinglist, request further information via mail and even monitor twitter and reply.</li>
	<li>I finally have a new SIM card. UMTS here I come.</li>
	<li>My Macbook Pro 13'' arrived. Will blog about it later</li>
	<li>I'm not into gaming much but I've been playing <a href="http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns/">Natural Selection</a> (Half-Life 1 Mod) since 2003 (!). Awesome game with tactical deepness. Logical consequence: Bought <a href="http://www.naturalselection2.com/">Natural Selection 2</a> Pre-Order Special Edition yesterday.</li>
