When I was a kid I had electric bass lessons for some years. Whenever I got a new song to play or a new technique to learn my teacher said: "Do it really slow in the beginning. Focus on doing it in the absolute right way. Once you got it perfect increase the tempo a bit. Repeat this until you reach the desired speed."

Appart from the fact that 'Practise is everything' this taught me that speed is not achieved by doing it as fast as possible but by practising quality. Speed is a by-product of quality work and a lot of practise.

Currently I'm experiencing this exact phonemena again. I have to find my way around in a big new codebase and by the way learn Ruby and Rails. I discover new exciting and new bugging things every day. And programming a feature or fix a bug takes me ages.

I focus a lot on doing it in the optimal way. Code quality is nothing to compromise on. And the great thing is that I can already see and feel how I get faster with it. Not by 'getting it done asap' but by really understanding what I'm doing. It feels good to work that way.

P.S. Code reviews are awesome!
