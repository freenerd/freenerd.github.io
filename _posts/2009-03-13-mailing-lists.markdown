In the last days, I have been pretty active in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-users">django-users</a> mailing list, because this has been my first week at work again for a long time (and I enjoyed it). I was searching the mailing list a lot to find answers to various problems and I even started to post some stuff. Reading the mailing list, I did a (super amateur) social and psychological analysis of the mailing list ecosystem and its inhabitants. Which led me to the question how to do better by myself and not become a sarcastic selfish troll.

These ones were useful:
