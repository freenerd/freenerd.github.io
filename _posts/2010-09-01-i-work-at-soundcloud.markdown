Starting today I work full-time at <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a> in the <a href="http://soundcloud.com/developers">API team</a>. I will make sure that <a href="http://www.thecloudplayer.com/">all</a> <a href="http://citysounds.fm/">the</a> <a href="http://raindropapp.com/">great</a> <a href="http://soundcloud.com/apps">apps</a> that access the API continue to work and thrive. I will answer questions of developers and users on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/soundcloudapi">mailing list</a> and in <a href="http://musichackday.org/">person</a>. And I will get my head around <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> big time.

Sounds like a shitload of fun, fuck yeah!

Among my fellow students I appear to be one of the few who starts a full-time job. I got asked several times how I got hired, so this is the story:

In summer 2008 I read about SoundCloud in <a href="http://de-bug.de/">De:Bug</a> (original article in german as <a href="http://de-bug.de/mag/5784.html">post</a> or in this <a href="http://www.de-bug.de/share/debug123.pdf">pdf</a> page 22). I got an invite to the private beta by <a href="http://www.tanith.org/?p=988">Tanith</a> and was impressed by the well-executed concept and the slick design. At that time I was searching for a brief summer internship. I figured that it should either be at <a href="http://ableton.com/">Ableton</a> or SoundCloud. My mail to jobs@soundcloud.com was answered so fast by <a href="http://eric.wahlforss.com/">Eric</a>, the CTO of SoundCloud, that I didn't even sent the application to Ableton ...

During the three-weeks internship I worked on the <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2008/10/14/soundcloud-player-for-facebook-now-viral/">Facebook app</a> and helped with the <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2008/10/13/thank-you-all/">launch</a>. After the internship I somehow stuck around. At <a href="http://berlin.musichackday.org/">Music Hack Day Berlin</a> we programmed <a href="http://www.freenerd.de/archives/2009/1132/">Tracksonamap</a> which we also used for <a href="www.twestival-fm.com/">Twestival.fm</a> later.

And I became a SoundCloud evangelist. If you hung out with me within the last two years chances are that I tried to give you SoundCloud stickers or made you promise to get an account. My identification with the Cloud is pretty high.

So in the last two years I was able to watch how the idea of SoundCloud grew into a real business and part of today's music industry. My enthusiasm for SoundCloud is unbroken. Thus it was only a logical step to get together when I finished my studies. And now I am really looking forward to a great time in the Cloud ...

BTW: We are <a href="http://soundcloud.com/pages/jobs">hiring</a>!
