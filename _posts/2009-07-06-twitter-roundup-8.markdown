<ul>
	<li>Deacreasing battery load results in decreasing mood</li>
	<li>I don't like Gravatar, because they have synced their Useraccounts with Wordpress.com and "Freenerd" already is taken. B#h!</li>
	<li>My Macbook seems to have a bug. When connecting the DisplayPort DVI Adapter on-the-fly the Mac sometimes freezes. Workaround is connecting the display in sleep mode. That works fine.</li>
	<li>Reading "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Switch-Rewiring-Edison-Google/dp/0393062287">The Big Switch</a>: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google" by Nicholas Carr. Well written book. I enjoy.</li>
	<li>Nokia E51 has an build-in internet radio client that works suprisingly well over 3G. Streaming <a href="http://byte.fm/">Byte.FM</a> in 128 kb.</li>
