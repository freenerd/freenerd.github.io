In three weeks on May 28/29th <a href="http://berlin.musichackday.org/2011/">Music Hack Day Berlin</a> is going to happen. I'm super psyched about it, because it's <a href="http://roelvanderven.com/">Roel</a> and me organizing it. <a href="http://mtvnetworks.de">MTV</a> is giving us their awesome venue right at the Spree and we also lined-up some kick-ass sponsors like <a href="http://www.ableton.com">Ableton</a> and <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> to pay for food and other comforts.

If you want to come as well, be quick and <a href="http://berlin.musichackday.org/2011/">sign-up</a>.
