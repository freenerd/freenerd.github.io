In August I spent a month working with the people at <a href="http://www.readmill.com">Readmill</a> and I thought I'd share some insights.

First: If you have an iPad, go <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readmill/id438032664">download the app</a> now and read epubs in it. If you don't have any, a great selection of classics can be found at <a href="http://www.feedbooks.com/">Feedbooks</a> and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>.

With my work I helped to improve Readmill's book meta data. More books now have covers, descriptions and download links.

The month with the team was great. They just moved into a new nice under-the-roof office in Kulturbrauerei (shared with <a href="http://loopc.am/">Loopcam</a>), are on a hiring spree and already assembled a killer core team. There is a certain atmosphere perceivable in the office for all the amazing things to happen in the near future. Prepare to track and sync all your readings through Readmill.
